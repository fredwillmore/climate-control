rails app for viewing playlists
ruby 3.2.4
rails 7.1.3

This is a project for learning Rails 7 features, specifically handling of page updates via Turbo Frames.

The project started during 2003 when I DJed a weekly night of leftfield selections at the Basement Pub. I had created a tool for the pub's website for entering the track selections as I was playing, so I ended up with a collection of playlists that didn't have a home after the website was decommissioned.
It was a fun and nostalgic trip to work with this data. I hadn't listened to many of the tracks for years and linking them in to Spotify gave me a reasonable if slightly clunky interface for perusing the playlists while I worked.
Sure, I could have saved myself a whole lot of trouble by just creating the playlists in Spotify directly, but I would have missed the opportunity to sharpen my skills with Rails.
