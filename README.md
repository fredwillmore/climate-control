Rails app for viewing playlist data.

ruby 3.2.4

rails 7.1.3

This is a project for learning Rails 7 features, specifically handling of page updates via Turbo Frames.

The project started during 2003 when I DJed a weekly night of leftfield selections at the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/basementpub" target="_blank">Basement Pub</a>. I had created a tool for the pub's website for entering the track selections as I was playing, so I ended up with a collection of playlists that didn't have a home after the website was decommissioned.

It was a fun and nostalgic trip to work with this data. I hadn't listened to many of the tracks for years and linking them in to Spotify gave me a reasonable if slightly clunky interface for perusing the playlists while I worked. The matching with Spotify track and artist data is not perfect, but you get the idea.

I have used Rails 7 with Hotwire/Stimulus to provide an interface for exploring the data, along with supplemental data from Spotify and other remote APIs.

Sure, I could have saved myself a whole lot of trouble by just creating the playlists in Spotify directly, but I would have missed the opportunity to sharpen my skills with Rails.
